# Residue property problems
Experiments related to protein residue level classification/regression problems. This is a generalization of tasks of residue pKa, ligandability, pocket, mutation stability and a lot more ML tasks which can be down to residue-level descriptions of protein properties.

We develop the model towards our Cys ligandability project first and try to make it extensible to other residue-level tasks as best as we can.
